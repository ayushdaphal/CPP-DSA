insert element at the bottom 
7 1 4 5 --> present in stack with 5 as stack top , insert 9 in bottom (below 7)
Approach:- keep poping the elements in the stack until u reach the stack empty condition 
           at stack empty--> insert the element 
           and then push in reverse order of which they were popped




reverse a stack  --> stack top side mei rakho and then use recursion
                    uppar aate hue start inserting at the bottom (upar wala logic)
                    return answer
